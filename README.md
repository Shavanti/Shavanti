## 👋 Hi, I'm Jili Xia (夏吉利)

### 🤞🏻 About Me

I received my Ph.D. from Xidian University and am currently with the Hangzhou Institute, Xidian University. My research focuses on visual perception and understanding, mainly on image quality assessment (IQA). I'm happy to share my latest work here and welcome discussions with others interested in this field.
